1. Implement the required parts in learnSkinModel.m and
classifyImg.m

2. runSkinClassification.m runs the whole system, including
training the models and the classification of the test images. The
parameter k specifies the number of images to test, starting from
0372.jpg. The returned value is the AUC averaged over the test
images. Be patient, as computing the ROC takes time. You can
replace the provided ROC implementation with a more efficient one.
